# perfmon: performance and debug plugin for Pumpkin

`perfmon.wasm` times every server tick, keeps 15 minutes of history, flags lag spikes, counts
entities, reports memory, and logs metrics to a CSV file. The Mineversed installer puts it in
`plugins/` and pre-approves its permissions.

## Commands

`/perf` (aliases `/tps`, `/lag`) needs operator level 2, or the `perfmon:perf` permission.

| Command | Shows |
|---|---|
| `/perf` | TPS over 5 s, 1 m, 5 m and 15 m; tick time mean, p50, p95, p99 and max; ticks over 50 ms; spike count; players; memory |
| `/perf entities` | Entity and player counts per dimension, and the 10 most common entity types |
| `/perf heap` | System memory, CPU threads, and this plugin's own sandbox memory |
| `/perf spikes` | The 10 most recent lag spikes, with how long ago and how long they took |
| `/perf report` | Writes a full report to `plugins/data/perfmon/report-<unix time>.txt`, including the last 1200 tick times |
| `/perf reset` | Clears the tick history and spike list |

TPS is worked out from tick durations: a tick that takes under 50 ms counts as 50 ms, because the
server sleeps for the rest. Colours: green is healthy, yellow is close to the limit, red is lagging.

## Memory

Pumpkin gives plugins the machine's total and used memory, not its own heap. `/perf heap` shows
the machine figure and perfmon's own WebAssembly memory. To see Pumpkin's own memory on Linux:

```bash
ps -o rss=,vsz= -C pumpkin
```

## Metrics log

Every `csv_interval_secs` seconds a line is added to `plugins/data/perfmon/metrics.csv`:

```
unix,tps_1m,mspt_mean,mspt_p95,mspt_max,ticks_over_50ms,spikes_total,players,entities,used_memory_bytes,plugin_heap_bytes
```

Open it in a spreadsheet to graph performance over hours or days.

## Config

`plugins/data/perfmon/config.toml` is written on first start. Restart the server after editing.

```toml
spike_threshold_ms = 100        # a tick at least this long is a lag spike
warn_on_spike = true            # log a console warning for spikes
spike_warn_cooldown_secs = 10   # at most one warning per this many seconds
csv_interval_secs = 60          # 0 turns the CSV log off
csv_count_entities = true       # count entities for each CSV line
```

## Permissions

`sys.info` for memory and CPU figures, and `fs.read.data` and `fs.write.data` for its config,
CSV and reports in its own data folder. Pre-approve them in `pumpkin.toml`:

```toml
[plugins.overrides.perfmon]
allowed_permissions = ["sys.info", "fs.read.data", "fs.write.data"]
```

## Building

```bash
./build.sh        # Linux/macOS, or .\build.ps1 on Windows
```

The file is `target/wasm32-wasip2/release/perfmon.wasm`.
